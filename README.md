Student Dropout Prediction & Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a real-world student dataset to understand academic performance patterns and predict student dropout risk.

Key highlights:

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 4,400+ student records with academic and demographic features

Applied data preprocessing including scaling, outlier removal, and feature selection

Built classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for dropout prediction

Used clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and regression to identify performance trends and student risk groups
